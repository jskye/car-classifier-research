Create list of samples from images:
 
```find ./negative_images -iname "*.jpg" > negatives.txt```

```find ./positive_images -iname "*.jpg" > positives.txt```

create many positive samples from provided ones

```perl bin/createsamples.pl positives.txt negatives.txt samples 1500\
"opencv_createsamples -bgcolor 0 -bgthresh 0 -maxxangle 1.1\
-maxyangle 1.1 maxzangle 0.5 -maxidev 40 -w 300 -h 175"```

nb. warnings may come up when running the perl script, since i had to change some files from png to jpg. 
This is because of [stricter libpng rules] (http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/125612/warning-pdflatex-libpng-warning-iccp-known-incorrect-srgb-profile)
but it still works with them. 


go to samples dir and run merge script

```python mergevec.py -v ../samples -o samples.vec```

run training

```opencv_traincascade -data classifier -vec samples/samples.vec -bg negatives.txt -numStages 20 -minHitRate 0.999 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.5 -numPos 1000 -numNeg 13 -w 300 -h 175 -mode BASIC -precalcValBufSize 512```

nb. [numPos needs to be somewhat less than the number of postive samples, based on background similarity, numStages, minHitRate]
